<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p>Climate change and environmental degradation are significant global challenges, impacting many sectors, particularly education. This research focuses on examining the risks posed by climate-related disasters on the educational system in Thailand, with a particular emphasis on children. The sensitivity of children to these changes is a critical issue that needs to be explored and understood in order to help stakeholders develop effective strategies for addressing future challenges.</p>
<p>The research has two main objectives. The first is to explore and develop a methodology to identify relevant education metrics that highlight the actual or potential, direct or indirect, adverse effects of climate change and environmental degradation on children’s participation in education and learning. The second objective is to identify the characteristics of schools, provinces, areas, and children that are exposed to significant risks from climate hazards, taking into account factors such as region, urban/rural settings, socio-economic status, disability, gender, age, and the location of schools in hardship areas.</p>
<p>This research represents an important step in connecting education data with climate risk factors, particularly by assessing the impact of these risks on children’s education. The findings will support future policy planning and operational efforts to ensure that responses to environmental challenges are effective and aligned with the needs of the education system.</p>
<section id="summary-of-objective-1-analysis" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary-of-objective-1-analysis">Summary of Objective 1 Analysis</h2>
<p>The analysis for Objective 1, which aims to explore and develop a methodology to link educational metrics with the impacts of climate change and environmental degradation, can be summarized as follows:</p>
<section id="development-of-the-climate-mapped-educational-risk-index-cmer-index" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="development-of-the-climate-mapped-educational-risk-index-cmer-index">Development of the Climate-Mapped Educational Risk Index (CMER Index)</h3>
<p>The study developed the Climate-Mapped Educational Risk Index (CMER), integrating data on extreme climate events and students’ academic performance. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to extract components that reveal the relationship between climate factors and educational risk. One of the extracted components shows a significant connection between anomalies in the duration of heavy rainfall and increased educational risk, as reflected in student learning outcomes. This methodology enhances the accuracy of the CMER Index by removing unrelated variability, offering a clearer reflection of educational risk linked to climate change. Compared to conventional index calculations that aggregate scores directly, this approach provides a more robust and reliable assessment of the specific risks associated with climate conditions.</p>
<p>The CMER Index was developed to provide detailed insights into educational risk at the school level. The index was designed to have a score range between 0 and 1, where a value closer to 1 indicates higher risk and a value closer to 0 indicates lower risk. To facilitate meaningful interpretation, the scale was categorized into three levels of risk: “Low Risk” (0 - 0.60), “Medium Risk” (0.60 - 0.80), and “High Risk” (&gt; 0.80). These thresholds were determined using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis to effectively distinguish educational risk.</p>
<p>Schools with a high CMER Index are more likely to have students with lower-than-expected learning outcomes. These lower academic performances are notably associated with anomalies in the duration of heavy rainfall, indicating a strong link between prolonged extreme weather events and educational risk. This approach ensures that the CMER Index provides a nuanced reflection of risk levels, enabling a clearer understanding of the degree of risk associated with climate change at the school level.</p>
</section>
<section id="geographical-distribution-of-the-cmer-index" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="geographical-distribution-of-the-cmer-index">Geographical Distribution of the CMER Index</h3>
<p>The distribution of CMER Index scores across Thailand was analyzed for the period between 2017 and 2021. It was found that 777 schools (2.95%) exhibited a high level of educational risk according to the CMER Index. Geographically, these high-risk schools were predominantly located in the southern provinces (e.g., Yala, Narathiwat, Pattani), northeastern provinces (e.g., Udon Thani, Nong Khai, Nakhon Phanom), central provinces (e.g., Nakhon Sawan, Phetchabun, Ayutthaya), and northern provinces (e.g., Mae Hong Son, Chiang Mai).</p>
<p>The analysis revealed that there are 24 provinces where the median CMER Index score exceeds 0.6, indicating that at least 50% of all schools within these provinces fall into the medium or higher risk categories. Among these provinces, Mae Hong Son, Narathiwat, and Yala have the highest median CMER scores. These three provinces also have the largest proportions of high-risk schools, with 39.6%, 37.6%, and 35.4% of all schools within each province classified as high-risk, respectively. In contrast, no high-risk schools were found in Bangkok, Phatthalung, Rayong, and Nonthaburi.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are 8 provinces where, despite having a low median CMER score (below 0.6), over 10% of the schools are classified as high-risk. These provinces are Uthai Thani, Ratchaburi, Loei, Phitsanulok, Chainat, Kamphaeng Phet, Chiang Mai, and Chiang Rai. This situation reflects potential educational inequalities in these areas that may be linked to extreme climate factors, indicating that even in provinces with an overall lower level of risk, certain schools face significant vulnerabilities related to climate impacts.</p>
</section>
<section id="cmer-index-categorized-by-educational-service-areas" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cmer-index-categorized-by-educational-service-areas">CMER Index Categorized by Educational Service Areas</h3>
<p>The analysis reveals that in both Primary Educational Service Areas (PESA) and Secondary Educational Service Areas (SESA), the majority of schools fall into the Low Risk category. However, PESA displays a higher proportion of schools classified as Moderate and High Risk compared to SESA. While the average CMER scores for both service areas are similar across all risk levels, the concentration of High-Risk schools is notably lower in SESA.</p>
<p>In the Primary Educational Service Areas (PESA), regions with the highest CMER scores and a significant proportion of High-Risk schools are primarily located in the southern region, followed by the central and northern regions. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Southern Region: Yala Districts 2 and 3, and Narathiwat Districts 1 and 2 exhibit the highest educational risks, with more than 50% of schools classified as high-risk. These areas have notably high median CMER scores, indicating a strong link between climate factors and educational challenges.</p></li>
<li><p>Central Region: Nakhon Sawan District 3, Phetchabun Districts 1 and 3, and Ang Thong also show elevated educational risk, with significant portions of schools categorized as high-risk. This suggests that central Thailand faces similar climate-related educational vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Northern Region: Chiang Mai District 5 and Mae Hong Son District 2 reflect trends of elevated risk, where the median CMER scores are high and a substantial number of schools fall into the high-risk category. This highlights that educational challenges linked to climate change are not isolated to any single region.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For the Secondary Educational Service Areas (SESA), two key regions stand out for having elevated CMER scores: Sing Buri-Ang Thong and Nong Khai. These areas exhibit a higher proportion of schools at risk, suggesting that educational vulnerabilities linked to climate change are also present in SESA, albeit to a lesser extent than in PESA regions.</p>
<p>The analysis of Research Objective 1 provides stakeholders with a valuable tool—the CMER Index—to pinpoint schools, areas, or educational service areas that face heightened educational risks associated with climate change. This index allows for a clear identification of vulnerable regions where targeted interventions are needed. However, designing effective interventions to support these high-risk schools may require more detailed information on the factors driving these risks. Therefore, the analysis under Research Objective 2 seeks to explore these underlying characteristics, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors that contribute to educational vulnerability, thereby guiding more informed and strategic intervention planning.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="summary-of-objective-2-analysis" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary-of-objective-2-analysis">Summary of Objective 2 Analysis</h2>
<p>For Research Objective 2, the analysis aims to explore and identify the non-climate factors that contribute to educational vulnerabilities across different regions in Thailand, focusing on actionable elements that can be addressed through policy and intervention. By performing separate regressions for Primary Educational Service Areas (PESA) and Secondary Educational Service Areas (SESA), the analysis uncovers how school-related factors affect the Climate-Mapped Educational Risk Index (CMER Index).</p>
<p>The analysis incorporates these non-climate factors—categorized into school characteristics, location &amp; accessibility, infrastructure &amp; connectivity, and student profiles—because they represent controllable elements that can be influenced by decision-makers. In contrast to climate factors, which are largely beyond human control, these factors offer practical opportunities for strategic interventions. By understanding their impact on educational outcomes, the Risk-Importance Matrix (RIM) serves as a tool to highlight regions and schools where targeted policies can effectively mitigate educational risks and improve outcomes related to climate change.</p>
<section id="summary-of-influential-non-climate-factors" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary-of-influential-non-climate-factors">Summary of Influential Non-Climate Factors</h3>
<p>The analysis of non-climate factors influencing the CMER Index was conducted separately for Primary Educational Service Areas (PESA) and Secondary Educational Service Areas (SESA). By examining these factors, the research offers targeted insights into educational vulnerabilities across different regions and provides guidance for tailored policy interventions. Key Findings are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>PESA Regions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Small School Size is a notable driver of educational risk, with smaller schools frequently facing resource and administrative limitations. A significant portion of these regions show a strong association between smaller school size and heightened educational risk.</p></li>
<li><p>Accessibility Issues play a critical role, including “Hard to Reach” and “School Distance” factors. Geographic inaccessibility, due to remoteness or school-community distances, significantly elevates educational risk across a sizable number of regions.</p></li>
<li><p>Lack of Infrastructure contributes to increased educational risks in certain areas. Inadequate access to services like electricity, water, and internet negatively affects the ability to maintain stable learning environments.</p></li>
<li><p>Poverty and Younger Students have a relatively lower impact on CMER but still present notable risks in certain areas, particularly where socioeconomic disparities are more pronounced.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SESA Regions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Small School Size has an even more pronounced effect on educational risk, with most regions exhibiting a strong association between limited resources in smaller schools and increased risk.</p></li>
<li><p>School Distance and Infrastructure Deficiencies moderately affect risk, with accessibility and basic infrastructure continuing to be relevant factors in some areas.</p></li>
<li><p>Younger Students show slight vulnerability, particularly contrasting with the trends observed in PESA regions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall Insights and Implications</strong></p>
<p>The most significant factor influencing educational risk across both PESA and SESA is school size, with a stronger impact observed in SESA regions. This finding underscores the need for resource allocation, administrative support, and infrastructure improvements specifically for smaller schools. Additionally, accessibility challenges, including school distance and remoteness, necessitate interventions to improve transportation and access to schools. Finally, the role of infrastructure and poverty, while moderate, suggests that holistic approaches are needed to ensure all students have equitable access to resources.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this analysis points to the critical role of addressing school size, accessibility, and infrastructure readiness to mitigate educational risks. A tailored, region-specific approach that enhances support for small schools, improves access in remote areas, and strengthens infrastructure will be crucial to promote equitable educational outcomes and resilience across both PESA and SESA regions.</p>
</section>
<section id="risk-importance-matrix" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="risk-importance-matrix">Risk-Importance Matrix</h3>
<p>The researcher developed the Risk-Importance Matrix (RIM) as an analytical tool to assess educational risks associated with climate anomalies across Primary Educational Service Areas (PESA) and Secondary Educational Service Areas (SESA). The RIM categorizes these areas based on the Climate-Mapped Educational Risk (CMER) Index and the relative importance (RI) of various non-climate factors, such as school size, socioeconomic conditions, and accessibility. The aim is to identify strategic focus groups for tailored interventions, ensuring efficient resource allocation and policymaking to mitigate educational vulnerabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Key Group Classifications within RIM</strong></p>
<p>Strategic Focus Group: The RIM highlights regions with high CMER and significant RI scores as priority areas for immediate policy action. These regions face compounded risks due to climate and non-climate factors, warranting urgent support. The classification criteria include CMER values slightly below 0.60 to encompass regions with moderate risk yet significantly influenced by specific non-climate factors. Regions surpassing an RI score of 40% are emphasized, pointing to a pronounced influence of factors like “Small School,” “School Distance,” or “Lack of Infrastructure” on educational risk.</p>
<p>Development Priority and Monitoring Groups: To delineate regions with varying degrees of risk, a diagonal boundary separates districts into either Development Priority or Monitoring categories based on their CMER values (ranging from 0.6 to 0.2) and RI scores. The Development Priority group includes districts with moderate to high risk and clear associations with influential factors, while the Monitoring group consists of regions with moderate to low CMER values but a strong link to non-climate factors, ensuring continued observation to preempt potential escalation in risk.</p>
<p>Low-Risk Group: Districts exhibiting very low CMER Index values, with minimal influence from non-climate factors, fall under the Low-Risk category. These areas currently show stable educational conditions and require the least immediate intervention but are still monitored to maintain their status and address any emerging vulnerabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Regions with Multiple Influential Factors</strong></p>
<p>Some PESA regions, like Narathiwat Area 1, Chiang Mai Area 5, and SESA regions, Sing Buri &amp; Ang Thong, face complex educational challenges driven by multiple non-climate factors. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Narathiwat Area 1 is impacted by both poverty and school distance, highlighting the combined influence of socioeconomic difficulties and accessibility challenges.</p></li>
<li><p>Chiang Mai Area 5 experiences heightened risk due to remoteness and school distance, suggesting that access to education is significantly hindered by location and travel difficulties.</p></li>
<li><p>Sing Buri &amp; Ang Thong is influenced by both “Small School” and “Lack of Infrastructure,” with RI scores of 84.76 and 70.72, respectively. The combination of these factors suggests that limited school size and infrastructure deficiencies together significantly contribute to educational risk in this region.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The analysis of these regions indicates that the interplay of factors such as location, poverty, school size, and infrastructure can compound educational risks. Targeted interventions addressing these combined influences are crucial for reducing overall risk effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Regions Dominated by a Single Factor</strong></p>
<p>Other regions are primarily influenced by a single dominant factor:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Small School: A prominent factor across both PESA and SESA regions, particularly in Narathiwat Area 2, Yala Area 1, Nakhon Phanom Area 1, Chachoengsao Area 1, and several SESA regions like Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya, Chachoengsao, and Ubon Ratchathani &amp; Amnat Charoen. These smaller schools, often with limited resources and support, are strongly associated with higher educational risks.</p></li>
<li><p>Poor Family: Regions like Pattani Area 3, Kalasin Area 3, Chainat, and Khon Kaen Area 1 face challenges mainly tied to socioeconomic factors, reflecting how poverty directly correlates with increased educational vulnerability.</p></li>
<li><p>Lack of Infrastructure: A critical factor in Mae Hong Son Area 2, Nong Khai Area 1, Udon Thani Area 2, Tak Area 2, and Sisaket &amp; Yasothon. These areas suffer from limited access to basic services, such as electricity, water, and internet, exacerbating educational challenges.</p></li>
<li><p>School Distance: Particularly influential in Trang Area 2, Chachoengsao Area 2, and Khon Kaen Area 5, where the distance between schools and community centers significantly affects access and student outcomes.</p></li>
</ul>
