This paper attempts to understand the underlying trends and the prevalence of research in
civic education and citizenship education over the last two decades (2000-2020), including its
relation to the authors’ backgrounds. The text data and the basic information of the authors
were collected from the SCOPUS and ERIC databases. A topic modeling method called
Structural Topic Model (STM) was used, thus allowing the inclusion of external data as well as
variation and correlation among the topic content in the analysis. Such inclusion is useful
since the authors are interested in the exogenous effect of their backgrounds on the topics
and the intertwining nature of topics in social science. This method is beneficial since it
combines the advantages of big data analytics with regression analysis on latent topics and
external factors. STM was used to analyze abstracts and titles of 4917 published articles. The
result suggests that the overall research trend has been stable and that researchers outside
of Western Europe and North America favor studying cultural dimensions and civic
participation, while Western peers concentrate on moral education.
