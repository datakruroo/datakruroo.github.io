In higher education, the cultivation of research competency is pivotal for students’ critical thinking development and their subsequent transition into the professional workforce. While statistics plays a fundamental role in supporting the completion of a research project, it is often perceived as challenging, particularly by students in majors outside mathematics or statistics. The connection between students’ statistical proficiency and their research competency remains unexplored despite its significance. To address this gap, we utilize the supervised machine learning approach to predict students’ research competency as represented by their performance in a research methods class, with predictors of students’ proficiency in statistical topics. Predictors relating to students’ learning behavior in a statistics course such as assignment completion and academic dishonesty are also included as auxiliary variables. Results indicate that the three primary categories of statistical skills—namely, the understanding of statistical concepts, proficiency in selecting appropriate statistical methods, and statistics interpretation skills—can be used to predict students’ research competency as demonstrated by their final course scores and letter grades. This study advocates for strategic emphasis on the identified influential topics to enhance efficiency in developing students’ research competency. The findings could inform instructors in adopting a strategic approach to teaching the statistical component of research for enhanced efficiency.
