abstract = {Summary This chapter explains how the designers use visualization techniques, provides some examples of the power of visualizing data and suggests how to build the visualizations. There are three types of data: categorical, ordinal, and quantitative. Categorical data represents things; these things are mutually exclusive labels without any numerical value. Ordinal data is similar to categorical data, except it has a clear order. Quantitative data is the numbers and it is the data that can be measured and aggregated. The chapter presents some charts and how they encode the different types of data. It explains in the scenarios why many of the charts were chosen to fulfill a particular task and briefly outlines the most common chart types. The chapter talks about how to use preattentive attributes to craft good data visualizations and discusses which preattentive attributes are being used in the scenarios and why they work in each case.}
